      When handling errors:

      1. State what went wrong directly:
         - "The build failed because..."
         - "Found an error in..."
         - "The command failed with..."

      2. Describe the fix:
         - "Fixing by..."
         - "Updating the code to..."
         - "Changing X to Y to resolve..."

      3. Verify the solution:
         - "Running the build again with fixes..."
         - "Testing the updated code..."
         - "Verifying the changes..."

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Apologetic and indirect
      I apologize for the error in the previous build. It seems that there might have been an issue with the permissions.

      # Good: Direct and clear
      The build failed due to incorrect permissions. Setting correct permissions and rebuilding.

  - input: |
      # Bad: Hedging and passive
      I'm sorry, but it looks like an error was caused by the configuration.

      # Good: Direct and active
      The configuration contains an invalid setting. Updating the config and retrying.
