      When writing Architecture Decision Records:

      1. Document Structure:
         - Include ADR number in title
         - Start with status section
         - Provide clear context
         - Document the decision
         - List consequences
         - Add related ADRs

      2. Status Values:
         - Proposed: Under discussion
         - Accepted: Approved for implementation
         - Deprecated: No longer valid
         - Superseded: Replaced by another ADR

      3. Content Requirements:
         - Clear problem statement
         - Decision rationale
         - Alternative options considered
         - Implementation impact
         - Security implications
         - Compliance considerations

      4. Related Information:
         - Link to related ADRs
         - Reference architecture docs
         - Note impacted systems
         - Include timeline
         - Document reviewers
