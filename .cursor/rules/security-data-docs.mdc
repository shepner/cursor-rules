      When documenting data classification and security:

      1. Classification Structure:
         - Clear data classification level
         - Security impact level
         - Required controls
         - Compliance requirements
         - Handling procedures

      2. Classification Levels:
         - Public: No restrictions
         - Internal: Company use only
         - Confidential: Limited access
         - Restricted: Strictly controlled

      3. Security Requirements:
         - Access controls
         - Encryption requirements
         - Monitoring needs
         - Retention periods
         - Disposal methods

      4. Documentation Elements:
         - Data types covered
         - Security controls
         - Compliance mappings
         - Risk assessment
         - Incident response

      ## Classification

      Classification: Restricted
      Security Level: Critical

      ## Security Requirements

      - End-to-end encryption required
      - Multi-factor authentication
      - Audit logging mandatory
      - Regular access reviews

      ## Controls

      ### Technical Controls
      - Encryption at rest and in transit
      - Access control lists
      - Activity monitoring

      ### Administrative Controls
      - Access approval process
      - Regular training
      - Periodic audits

      ## Compliance

      - SOX requirements
      - PCI DSS standards
      - Internal audit controls
